# Estimator is based on Arhi Script but adapted to needs of Cura

## Requirement
 * Needs M73 and M117 codes in your G-Code in Cura format. M73 contains percentage done and M117 remaining time.
 * You have to add Cura Post Processing Script "Display Progress On LCD" and activate "Time Remaining" and "Percentage" to add necessary information to G-Code file. 
## Notes
 * In case there are no M117 codes that can be recognised the original estimator from OctoPrint will be used
 * In case SDCARD print is used the original estimator from OctoPrint will be used
